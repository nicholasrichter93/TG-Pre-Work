  <h1 class="title">Top Vacation Spots</h1>
  <h5>By: Stacy Gray</h5>
  <h6>Published: 2 Days Ago</h6>

  <p style="font-family:Arial;">The world is full of fascinating places. Planning the perfect vacation involves packing up, leaving home, and experiencing something new.</p>

  <h2 class="destination">1. Florence, Italy</h2>
  <div class="description">A city-size shrine to the Renaissance, Florence offers frescoes, sculptures, churches, palaces, and other monuments from the richest cultural flowering the world has known. Names from its dazzling historical pastDante, Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelliare some of the most resonant of the medieval age. <a href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/city-guides/florence-italy/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>.

      <li>Museums</li>
      <li>Bike Tours</li>
      <li>Historical Monuments</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 class="destination">2. Beijing, China</h2>
  <div class="description">A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on viewin the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

  </div>

  <h2 class="destination">3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
  <div class="description">The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city centercomplete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.

    <h1>Typography</h1>
      <p>While typography has been practiced for many centuries, digital font design is a relatively new discipline. There are some great examples of old-school fonts (also called typefaces) which have been adapted for use on digital displays. However, I would like to highlight a few of my favorite fonts that were created with screens in mind.</p>

    <div class="editorial">
      <h2>Serif</h2>
      <p>Serifs are the small features at the end of strokes within letters. These features are <strong>functional as well as decorative</strong>. Serif fonts are widely used for body text (eg. articles) because they are considered easier to read than sans-serif fonts in print.</p>
      <p><em>Serif fonts can often create a feeling of traditionalism and antiquity, due to their common use in printed materials for many years.</em></p>

    <h1>Typography</h1>
      <p>While typography has been practiced for many centuries, digital font design is a relatively new discipline. There are some great examples of old-school fonts (also called typefaces) which have been adapted for use on digital displays. However, I would like to highlight a few of my favorite fonts that were created with screens in mind.</p>

      <h2>Serif</h2>
      <p>Serifs are the small features at the end of strokes within letters. These features are <strong>functional as well as decorative</strong>. Serif fonts are widely used for body text (eg. articles) because they are considered easier to read than sans-serif fonts in print.</p>
      <p><em>Serif fonts can often create a feeling of traditionalism and antiquity, due to their common use in printed materials for many years.</em></p>
